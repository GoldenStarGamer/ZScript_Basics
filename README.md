## Important notes

1. This document was written by a person who learned to use ZScript without any prior programming experience. I strive to use the correct terminology and not dumb things down but I also may purposefully overexplain certain things or initially present them in a simplified manner for the sake of beginner-friendliness.
2. While all code examples in the guide are made to be runnable, it's *not* recommended to use them as is: many of them are purposefully inefficient, and the guide tends to iterate over them, improving various aspects while explaining new techniques. Examples are meant to be just that: examplesâ€”not ready-made solutions.
3. This document is a guide, not a wiki. As such, it's designed to be read from beginning to end. Chapters are not self-contained and often rely on information explained earlier in the guide, so it's not recommended to skip anything.
